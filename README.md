# Business Messages: NodeJS snippets

These code snippets demonstrate how to perform operations with the Business Messages API using NodeJS.

This project contains multiple examples. Each file contains a single operation with the Business Messages API.

To run these scripts you need to be signed up with [Business Messages](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/set-up/register).

## Documentation

The documentation for the Business Messages API can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/reference/rest).

## Prerequisite

You must have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) (aka gcloud)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Before you begin

1.  [Register with Business Messages](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/set-up/register).
1.  Once registered, follow the instructions to [enable the APIs for your project](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/set-up/register#enable-api).

## How to run the NodeJS scripts?

1. Locate the file with the code snippet you want to execute.
1. Replace all the values of the constants on top of the file that are set to `EDIT_HERE`.
1. Make sure the path to your [service account key](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/quickstarts/prerequisite-setup?hl=en#create_a_service_account) is correct. The scripts use the default path as `./service_account_key.json`.
1. On your terminal, run `node file-name-to-be-executed.js`
